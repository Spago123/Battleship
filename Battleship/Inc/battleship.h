 * @brief Library used to play battleship
 * @note to play this game you need two stm32f3 boards
 *       and you have to connect those boards with two PC-s
 *       also you have to connect those boards in the following way:
 *       -----------------------------
 *       | Board 1 pin | Board 2 pin | 
 *       |     PB1     |     PB2     |
 *       |     PB2     |     PB1     |
 *       |     PA2     |     PA3     |
 *       |     PA3     |     PA2     |
 *       -----------------------------
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2023-11-07
 * 
 * @note USART2 is used for communication between boards,
 *       while USART1 is used for communication between board and PC
